# Telosys user documentation

User documentation in HTML format

   
   

To guarantee the reliability of the documentation some HTML files are generated by Telosys components.

The Java tooling to generate the user documentation is also located in this project.

Documentation generation is done with the following Java methods :  

- ``ObjectsDocumentation.genDoc()``   
  to generate the documentation of all **usable objects in the templates**   


- ``LanguagesDocumentation.genDoc()``   
  to generate the documentation of all **target languages specificities**
